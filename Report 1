Web Interface
web_interface.html

Functionality: The user pastes Rust/Anchor code into a text area and clicks the "Analyze" button, which sends a POST request to a local server (http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze).

Presentation: The interface is clean, with a user-friendly design and clear instructions, which is a plus for the user experience.

Flask Backend
app.py

Integration with the AI Model: The application loads a pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model from the file solana_ai_model_v2.keras.

Request Processing: When code is received, it is converted to lowercase and split into tokens. For the first 10 tokens, their lengths are calculated, and these values form the input vector for the model. The result is interpreted using two possible labels – "Safe" and "Potential Vulnerability".

Potential Limitations: The approach for feature extraction (simply using token lengths) is very simplified and may not reflect the true complexity of the code. This could lead to inaccurate predictions from the AI model.

Regular Expressions for Vulnerability Analysis
mark_vulnerabilities.py

Main Checks:

Missing Access Control: If the code contains calls like transfer( or invoke_signed(, but lacks checks for is_signer, it is flagged as a potential vulnerability.

Unchecked Arithmetic: If arithmetic operations are present without using safe functions like checked_add, etc., a warning is added.

Hardcoded Seeds: The script looks for patterns that indicate the use of hardcoded values (e.g., using b!(...)).

Dangerous unwrap(): The presence of .unwrap() also triggers a warning.

Missing Signer Check: If there is no check for is_signer and no use of a function like require!, this omission is flagged.

Comments:

This regex-based approach can detect some typical issues, but it may also produce false positives or miss more complex scenarios.

The checks are based on the presence or absence of specific strings, making them vulnerable to cases where the code syntax varies slightly.

Extraction of Public Functions from Rust Files
extract_sol_fns.py

Purpose: This script traverses the solana-projects directory (located in the home directory), finds Rust files, and uses a regular expression to extract all public functions (i.e., pub fn ...).

Output: The result is saved to a file named solana_pub_functions.csv for further analysis or reference.

Notes:

Using regular expressions to parse code might prove insufficiently flexible in more complex cases, especially if the code contains nested blocks or unconventional structures.

Overall Evaluation and Suggestions for Improvement

Strengths:

The project integrates two approaches for analysis – an AI-based approach and a heuristic (regex) method, which can provide a more comprehensive assessment of the smart contracts' security.

The web interface is intuitive and allows for quick verification of the input code.

Areas for Improvement:

AI Model: The feature extraction based solely on token lengths is overly simplistic. For a more accurate assessment, consider using more sophisticated text embeddings, transformers, or other models specifically trained for analyzing source code.

Regular Expressions: Although fast, regex might not cover all cases. It is recommended to implement more flexible checks or to use dedicated parsers for Rust that can analyze the syntax structure more accurately.

Functional Reliability: When integrating the two approaches (AI and regex), it is important to consider how their results are combined – whether they should validate each other or be presented separately to the user.

Conclusion

The project represents an interesting and ambitious initiative for the automatic analysis of vulnerabilities in Solana smart contracts. Although its basic architecture is sound, there is room for improvement both in the machine learning-based analysis and in the use of regular expressions. As the project evolves, a focus on deeper syntactic analysis and richer feature extraction could significantly enhance the tool's accuracy and utility.
